# 1 Introduction

For this lab, we first set up the Eclipse IDE. Then for the lab we had to test two classes, the Range and DataUtilities classes. From these classes, we had to pick five methods from each to unit test. Once we had picked those five methods from each class, we began testing using the boundaries and equivalence classes we had brainstormed together. The testing required us to look into documentation (Javadoc) for the classes and their methods to be able to understand what they do, what they return, and the arguments they take in. Overall, the process of finding errors and thinking of all possible cases was a long process, but we think we were able to cover a huge area of potential errors and bugs.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

As a team, we first created a document to hold all of the information about Black Box testing that we were going to gather. It was first important to brainstorm and think out possible requirements that each method we picked in the Range and DataUtilities classes should meet. We also thought of areas in which developers might have overlooked certain inputs to the methods to identify areas where we might want to develop tests. Then, we created Equivalence classes for the inputs to each method. It was important to focus on creating Equivalence classes that clearly defined inputs we needed to analyze, and that also matched the ideas we thought of during our brainstorming. Once this step was done, we used the Equivalence classes to clearly define our partitions, so we knew what exactly we would be coding for the tests. We also performed a boundary value analysis for each method based on these partitions we had made as well as the natural boundaries of the variables. Mocking was used on the Values2d and the KeyedValues classes that DataUtilities used. This made it easier to write shorter code and to emulate other classes without having to directly use them. It also helps to focus only on the class under test and not the classes that are being used by the class under test. However, it also requires in depth knowledge of the methods that are being tested and the ways in which these methods are executed. This is needed in order to be able to create a proper mock that is able to replicate the mocked classes properly. 

Partitions for Doubles: Double.NaN and a valid double (ex. 2.3).
The Boundaries of a Double were: Lower Bound: 2-1022  and Upper Bound: (2-2-52)·21023

Partitions for Range Object: Null, Valid Range (ex. (2,4)), a range containing a Double.NaN

Partitions for KeyedValues Object: Null or a Valid KeyedValues object

Partitions for Values2D Object: Null or a valid Values2D object

Partitions for Integers: Valid integer, or an int casted Double.NaN
The Boundaries of a Integer were: Lower Bound: -2147483648 and Upper Bound: 2147483647

Partitions for Int Array: Null array, a valid int array with integers, an array that contains an int casted Double.NaN

Partitions for a 2D double array: A 2d array with valid doubles, a 2d array with a Double.NaN, and a null 2d array

Partition for a double array: An array with valid doubles, an array with a Double.NaN, and a null array

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team decided that the best way to go about this lab was to work at the same time in a voice call. To start off, we chose to test the Range class. We first picked 5 methods and wrote them down in a google docs together. Then we wrote out the boundary value analysis and equivalence classes together, thinking about all the possible things we could add in them. Once that was done, as a group we began writing the unit tests up by using our equivalence classes and boundary analysis exploration we had done earlier. We also made sure that we covered as much ground as we could when we made these tests to make sure we tested each method thoroughly. Once the Range class was finished, we then repeated what we did for it for the DataUtilities class. After we finished the testing, we then discussed the lab report as a group and wrote down the answers while still working together in a call.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

We encountered some difficulties mainly when trying to set up Eclipse for the unit tests. The instructions given in the lab document were unclear on the ways in which Eclipse should be properly set up to ensure that unit tests can be run properly. Another great difficulty was creating unit tests for the methods in the Range and DataUtilities classes. This was because it was hard to find all the requirements for the methods, and explore them thoroughly. Black Box testing, and techniques such as Equivalence Classes and Boundary-Value Analysis, helped us to analyze each method and come up with the appropriate tests for them. However, it was still difficult to create proper Equivalence Classes and Boundaries from those classes. A lesson we learned is that when doing these unit tests, it's best to brainstorm ideas first with your group members about areas with potential bugs or things we need to check out for a method. We also learned that it is hard to know the correct expected outcome in most situations. Therefore, the expected outcome needs to be assumed by the tester and brought up to the developers at a later time.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab document was confusing to read. It first mentioned setting up Eclipse on a singular computer to conduct all tests, however all computers need to have the unit tests on them for the demos. At the same time, not all libraries needed were given in the artifacts.zip file. A major library, the hamcrest-all library, was missing from the artifacts.zip file and we had to decipher the error message and find that outside of the lab. Setting up Eclipse with the correct libraries was also difficult as the instructions given did not match what needed to be done. For example, for the libraries to work correctly, all of the libraries needed to be added to the classpath of the project. However, this is not mentioned anywhere in the lab document when setting up Eclipse.
